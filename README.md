   ## Architecture 
   * The architecture used to create this app is Model-View-Viewmodel, it seperated the app into Data 
    layer/Domain/Ui Layer resulting in a readable,robust code. It also leverages the power of some android jetpack 
    libraries (Retrofit, Coroutines, Hilt, Lifecycle, Room).
